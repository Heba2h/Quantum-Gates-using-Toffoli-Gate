# Quantum-Gates-using-Toffoli-Gate

This is a simple Quantum Gate Tester application built using Python's Tkinter and Qiskit libraries. The application allows users to simulate various quantum gates, such as NOT, NAND, AND, FANOUT, CNOT, and OR gates. The implementation is based on the Toffoli gate, with the other gates being derived from it.

## Features

- **Gate Selection**: Choose from a variety of quantum gates using a dropdown menu.
- **Input Specification**: Enter input values or binary strings depending on the selected gate.
- **Circuit Visualization**: View the quantum circuit diagram for the selected gate.
- **Bloch Vector Visualization**: Observe the Bloch vector representation of the quantum state after simulation.
